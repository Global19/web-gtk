            <p class="mtext">The PHP-GTK manual is currently being written by 
              a team of little easter bunnies. This means the manual is not here 
              right now but you can see the latest development version at <a href="http://www.phpuk.org/gtk/">http://www.phpuk.org/gtk/</a></p>
            <p class="mtext">If you have some time to spare then please help us 
              with the manual. We need lots of people to document all of the objects, 
              whether you want to write the docs or are willing to check the example 
              code and comment on the content of the documentation please drop 
              me a line at <a href="mailto:jmoore@php.net">jmoore@php.net</a>. 
              Any help is gratefully received.</p>
