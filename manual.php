<h1>Documentation</h1>

<P>
The PHP-GTK manual is currently being written by 
a team of little easter bunnies.  This means the manual is not here 
right now but you can see the latest development version at 
<?php print_link('http://www.phpuk.org/gtk/'); ?>.
</P>

<P>
If you have some time to spare then please help us 
with the manual; we need lots of people to document all of the objects!
Whether you want to write the documentaion, or are willing to check the example 
code and comment on the content of the documentation, please drop 
us a line at <? print_email('jmoore@php.net'); ?>.  Any help is gratefully
received.
</P>
