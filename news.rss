 <title>Documentation Filling Out</title>
 <link>http://gtk.php.net</link>
 <description>
This week, the PHP-GTK 2 documentation broke the 44.44% barrier: nearly
half of the classes and their methods, properties and signals are
documented. PHP-GTK 2 consists of 202 classes with nearly 2,900 methods,
and many signals and properties. As the documentation matures, PHP-GTK 2
becomes easier to work with as the answers to many common problems become
easier to find.

We ask you to help us fill in the white spaces and create examples for
others to learn from. Writing documentation not only helps the project, 
but also helps you learn through experimenting with new methods, and gain
a better understanding of the inner workings of the project. Interested? 
The doccing tutorial explains the first steps, and the php-gtk-doc mailing
list is the central place for all manual issues. All help creating examples
and writing or translating documentation, is appreciated.

 <title>PHP-GTK 2 Alpha Re-release</title>
 <link>http://gtk.php.net</link>
 <description>
Apparently, PEAR infrastructure tools (due to a deficiency in PHP's
version_compare() function) cannot handle a version modifier called "zeta". We
had to rename it to good old "alpha", re-package and re-release. Download it if you plan
to use PEAR's or gnope.org's packages.

 <title>PHP-GTK 2 Zeta Release</title>
 <link>http://gtk.php.net</link>
 <description>
  After a long development cycle, PHP-GTK team is proud to announce the first
  official preview release of PHP-GTK 2. Since everyone has been
  patiently waiting for this release for quite a while, we have
  decided to skip a few letters of the Greek alphabet and go straight to
  zeta, which does not get nearly enough respect in the software world compared
   to its brethren. So, without further ado, please welcome PHP-GTK 2.0.0 Zeta!

 <title>PHP-GTK 2 Resources</title>
 <link>http://gtk.php.net</link>
 <description>
The number of PHP-GTK 2 resources has been climbing steadily as development
continues. As it stands now there are eight PHP-GTK 2 packages available from
PEAR. The availability of the PHP-GTK 2 documentation provides an online
resources for developers needing help with the PHP-GTK 2 API. Included in the
online documentation is a new tutorial on using Glade with PHP-GTK 2. In
addition several websites devoted to PHP-GTK 2 have cropped up providing a wide
range of resources. Finally, the first PHP-GTK 2 book, Pro PHP-GTK, has been 
published. All of these resources should provide a strong launching point for 
any developer wanting to get a head start working with the soon-to-be-released 
alpha version of PHP-GTK 2.

 <title>Moving toward a release of PHP-GTK 2</title>
 <link>http://gtk.php.net</link>
 <description>
This month PHP-GTK 2 has continued its march toward an initial release. Andrei
has been working through bug fixes and implementing new features. Recently he 
added the ability to use GtkListStores and GtkTreeStores as if they were 
iterators or arrays. This makes it much easier to work with data models for 
GtkTreeView and GtkComboBox. The documentation team has been working hard to 
fill out the docs. Several new pages have been added and the PHP-GTK 2 docs 
will soon make their first appearance on the PHP-GTK website.

Even though PHP-GTK 2 is not quite stable yet, several applications have been 
developed using the CVS version. There are now four PHP-GTK 2 packages 
available on PEAR including the newly added Gtk2_ScrollingLabel and 
Gtk2_PHPConfig. Christian Weiske has released the first game developed with 
PHP-GTK 2: Minesweeper.

 <title>PHP-GTK 2 Progress</title>
 <link>http://gtk.php.net</link>
 <description>
Development of PHP-GTK 2 is steadily picking up pace. The last month has seen
plenty of activity not only in commits to CVS but in other parts of the PHP-GTK
2 community also:
 - The PHP-GTK 2 documentation is filling out. More classes have been
   documented and given examples (especially the GtkTree* classes).
 - Source code highlighting has been added to the PHP-GTK 2 manual.
 - Most of the get_size* methods have been implemented.
 - 85% of all methods and properties have been implemented. The other 15% need
   to be written by hand, and more are being added every week. (Some
   automatically generated methods may not be implemented correctly and will
   have to be re-written by hand. Therefore, the actual coverage figures may be
   slightly lower than those above)
 - The Gnope installer has been downloaded over 8000 times since its release
   last month.
 - Gtk2_PHPConfig an application that makes it easy to modify php.ini files,
   has been proposed on PEAR by Anant Narayanan.

    <title>Win9x Support in PHP 5.1</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>
     There is talk on the PHP Internals mailing list about removing support for
     Win9x (95/98/2000/ME) from PHP 5.1. For most PHP developers this isn't much
     of a big deal but for PHP-GTK 2 developers it may have a much more significant
     impact. If you have reasons to keep Win9x support in PHP 5, make sure to voice
     your opinion!

    <title>Getting Ready for PHP-GTK 2</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>
     PHP-GTK 2 is getting closer and closer to a first release every day.
     At the International PHP Conference, Andrei gave a talk about the 
     current status of PHP-GTK 2 and the direction it is heading. Since then,
     excellent progress has been made with trees and editable cells. Parameter
     reflection has also been added thanks to Christian. The lastest efforts
     have led to the first set of practical applications written with PHP-GTK
     2. Christian's reflection browser makes it easy to take a look at the
     inner workings of PHP-GTK 2 classes and can be used as simple documentation.

    <title>A Message From Andrei</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>I finished porting the first demo from PyGTK, the stock
    item browser. It's in demos/stock-browser.php and in the process I've
    implemented a fair amount of new GtkTreeView/GtkListStore functions.
    PHP-GTK 2 is coming along!
    Maybe a very early alpha release is due...
    -Andrei
    Any tester or developers interested in helping (Especially to port old
    override files so that CList and CTree work) please contact the PHP-GTK
    Dev mailing list.
    In other news, Christian Weiske is making steady progress on the
    documentation system. Docs skeletons can now be automatically generated
    for all of the classes that have been implemented so far. Read his post
    to the documentation mailing list for more details.</description>

    <description>It's getting close to conference season and with that comes
    a few talks about PHP-GTK. At the International PHP Conference, Ben
    Ramsey will be holding a talk titled "PHP in a Whole New World: Desktop
    Applications Built in PHP-GTK." At the same conference Andrei Zmievski
    will be giving a much anticipated talk called, "Say Hello To PHP-GTK 2."
    The latest issue of the International PHP Magazine has an article by
    David Heath called "Free You CMS" which talks about "building an offline
    desktop client tool that is a synthesis of several exciting technologies:
    PHP-GTK, SQLite, and XML-RPC."
    PECL developers, Alan Knowles and Val Khokhlov have release a new version
    of bcompiler. bcompiler lets you "create a exe file of a PHP-GTK
    application."</description>
