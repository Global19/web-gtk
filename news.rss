     Jeremy Johnstone will be presenting a talk titled "GUI Development in
     PHP-GTK2" at the International PHP Conference in November. Anyone going
     to the conference should be sure to check out his talk. The discussion
     includes "in depth coverage of developing a GUI application in PHP-GTK2
     including tools you can use to allow you to rapidly develop new applications."

    <title>Win9x Support in PHP 5.1</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>
     There is talk on the PHP Internals mailing list about removing support for
     Win9x (95/98/2000/ME) from PHP 5.1. For most PHP developers this isn't much
     of a big deal but for PHP-GTK 2 developers it may have a much more significant
     impact. If you have reasons to keep Win9x support in PHP 5, make sure to voice
     your opinion!

    <title>PHP-GTK 1.0.2 Released</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>
     PHP-GTK 1.0.2 is a minor release that fixes a bug in the build process
     that prevented PHP-GTK from being installed with the newly released PHP
     4.4.x branch.

    <title>Getting Ready for PHP-GTK 2</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>
     PHP-GTK 2 is getting closer and closer to a first release every day.
     At the International PHP Conference, Andrei gave a talk about the 
     current status of PHP-GTK 2 and the direction it is heading. Since then,
     excellent progress has been made with trees and editable cells. Parameter
     reflection has also been added thanks to Christian. The lastest efforts
     have led to the first set of practical applications written with PHP-GTK
     2. Christian's reflection browser makes it easy to take a look at the
     inner workings of PHP-GTK 2 classes and can be used as simple documentation.

    <title>A Message From Andrei</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>I finished porting the first demo from PyGTK, the stock
    item browser. It's in demos/stock-browser.php and in the process I've
    implemented a fair amount of new GtkTreeView/GtkListStore functions.
    PHP-GTK 2 is coming along!
    Maybe a very early alpha release is due...
    -Andrei
    Any tester or developers interested in helping (Especially to port old
    override files so that CList and CTree work) please contact the PHP-GTK
    Dev mailing list.
    In other news, Christian Weiske is making steady progress on the
    documentation system. Docs skeletons can now be automatically generated
    for all of the classes that have been implemented so far. Read his post
    to the documentation mailing list for more details.</description>

    <description>PHP-GTK 2 is making great strides toward a working release.
    Andrei's relentless work has lead to a current CVS version that can run
    non-trivial scripts. See the general mailing list archives for an example.
    Take a look at the change log for the latest updates.</description>

    <description>It's getting close to conference season and with that comes
    a few talks about PHP-GTK. At the International PHP Conference, Ben
    Ramsey will be holding a talk titled "PHP in a Whole New World: Desktop
    Applications Built in PHP-GTK." At the same conference Andrei Zmievski
    will be giving a much anticipated talk called, "Say Hello To PHP-GTK 2."
    The latest issue of the International PHP Magazine has an article by
    David Heath called "Free You CMS" which talks about "building an offline
    desktop client tool that is a synthesis of several exciting technologies:
    PHP-GTK, SQLite, and XML-RPC."
    PECL developers, Alan Knowles and Val Khokhlov have release a new version
    of bcompiler. bcompiler lets you "create a exe file of a PHP-GTK
    application."</description>

    <title>Expanding Horizons</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>PHP-GTK development is growing in several directions. A
    recent barrage of commits by Andrei shows that PHP-GTK 2 is moving 
    ever closer towards a working release. At the same time, Ivan Rodriguez 
    has been helping to add some GtkExtra classes to the CVS versions of 
    both PHP-GTK 1 and PHP-GTK 2.
    Other PHP communities are contributing to PHP-GTK development in their 
    own way. PEAR has released another class, Gtk_Styled, to help PHP-GTK 
    developers write cleaner, more stable code. The folks over at Zend have 
    recognized everyone who has contributed to PHP-GTK development, 
    documentation or the web site by adding them to the "Zend Who's Who of 
    PHP".
    In other news, the GDK section of the manual has been completely 
    translated into Russian.</description>

    <title>PHP-GTK in business</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/</link>
    <description>There has been a lot of 
    discusson lately about the role PHP-GTK can and is playing in the 
    business world. Several people have commented
    on the php-gtk-general mailing list about how they have developed 
    secure, cross-platform applications for use in business with PHP-GTK.
    Using tools such as Roadsend's PHP Compiler, developers are able to 
    create and distribute PHP-GTK applications that don't require the 
    user to have a working installation first.
    On the international level, PHP-GTK documentation is being translated
    into Russian thanks to the work of Andrew Krasnyansky. Also, the 
    organizers of the International PHP Conference have put out a call
    for papers. One of the requested topics is PHP-GTK.</description>

    <description>While work continues on PHP-GTK 2, there has been some big news with PHP-GTK 1. The continuing documentation efforts have produced two new tutorials and lots of new doc pages. To go along with all of the new documentation, Christian Weiske has released manualBrowser, a PHP-GTK application to make it easier to read and search the docs offline. The folks over at PEAR have even jumped on the PHP-GTK bandwagon. There are two new gtk classes and a new PHP-GTK interface for PHPUnit.</description>

    <title>PHP-GTK 1.0.1 released</title>
    <link>http://gtk.php.net/download.php</link>
    <description>PHP-GTK version 1.0.1 is the first release in nine months. However, this release is also proof that activity in the PHP-GTK camp has indeed increased and is rapidly moving along toward a stable PHP-GTK 2. PHP-GTK 1.0.1, affectionately termed the "you thought we were done?" version, implemented and exposed some new methods for GtkToolbar, reimplemented Gdk::cursor_new_from_pixmap() "so it actually works," and updated the build system. See the changelog for full details. In other news, the manual has been updated to include syntax highlighting (coloring) in the code examples.</description>

    <description>The PHP-GTK Web site now features a regularly updated listing of documentation updates. The listing is displayed on the home page and is updated every night when the manual is updated from CVS. The updates are listed in reverse chronological order (the newest at the top), and the latest fifteen updates are shown at any given time. In addition, a documentation update feed is available in RSS format.</description>

    <link>http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-gtk-dev&amp;m=109104992017688&amp;w=2</link>
    <description>In a thread on php-gtk-dev entitled "Gtk+ 2.2 or 2.4?", developers discussed whether to base PHP-GTK 2 on GTK+ 2.2 or 2.4. The decision was quickly made, with no opposition or argument, to proceed with using GTK+ 2.4. For more information on GTK+ 2.4, read this post and this post.</description>
