<?php
commonHeader("PHP-GTK 1 Manual Notes");

<p>
The manual notes interface allows you to add notes to the online
version of the PHP-GTK 1 manual. These notes are then shared with other
PHP-GTK users when they browse the manual online.
</p>
<p>
Periodically, the developers may go through the notes and incorporate
the information in them into the documentation proper.
</p>
<p>
These notes are only visible at <a href="http://gtk.php.net/manual1/">gtk.php.net</a>
because that's where the database that stores them is located.  If (when) the
PHP-GTK website is mirrored in several locations, we'll work out a way of 
having the notes available across all the mirror sites.
