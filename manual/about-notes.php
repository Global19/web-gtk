<P>
The manual notes interface allows you to add notes to the online
version of the PHP-GTK manual. These notes are then shared with other
PHP users when they browse the manual online.
</P>
<P>
Periodically, the developers may go through the notes and incorporate
the information in them into the documentation proper.
</P>
<P>
These notes are only visible at <A href="http://gtk.php.net/manual/">gtk.php.net</A>
because that's where the database that stores them is located.  If (when) the
PHP-GTK website is mirrored in several locations, we'll work out a way of 
having the notes available across all the mirror sites.

<P>
These notes are <B>not</B> the place to report <A href="http://gtk.php.net/bugs">bugs</A>!
