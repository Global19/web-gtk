            <p class="mtext"> Too often PHP is thought of as only an HTML-embedded 
              Web scripting language. But it is also a very full-featured general 
              purpose language that can be used for much more. One of the goals 
              behind this project was to prove that PHP can be used to write client-side 
              GUI applications. </p>
            <p class="mtext">There is a mailing list for PHP-GTK. To subsribe, 
              send blank email to <a href="mailto:php-gtk-subscribe@lists.php.net">php-gtk-subscribe@lists.php.net</a>. 
              The address of the list itself is <a href="mailto:php-gtk@lists.php.net">php-gtk@lists.php.net</a>. 
              The list is archived at <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-gtk&r=1&w=2">MARC</a>. 
            </p>
            <p class="mtext">This extension is still in early beta phase to not 
              expect everything to work right now. If you have problems then your 
              first port of call should be the manual and the mailing list. Any 
              php-gtk related questions should be sent to <a href="mailto:andrei@php.net">andrei@php.net</a> 
              unless they are related to the manual where they should be sent 
              to <a href="mailto:jmoore@php.net">jmoore@php.net</a>. If you have
